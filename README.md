### While I was a Logiscool Trainer, I've worked on some personal projects that helped me understand and better teach on the Scoolcode platform. 

*Note that I've saved the files as .js files but the actual programming language for the Scoolcode platform is StageScript*

## Smart Cube

You can find the game [here](https://play.scoolcode.com/65fc87e3aca38318d2c91d63?).

Smart Cube is inspired by [1-Square](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-1-square), a puzzle game made by Armor Games, and is available on Coolmath Games and other gaming platforms.

1-Square was given as the contest theme for a Unity Development Intership, where I was selected with my original project that can be found [here](https://github.com/dragos-pk3/smartcube-unity).

This project was my first game ever made with Unity and I took the time to write a version for the Scoolcode Platform.

## End For Wisagi

### About the Title: **End For Wisagi**

The title **End for Wisagi** is a playful nod to the **four core stats** of the game that enhances player experience by giving meaninful choice elements.

- **Endurance** (End) - Increases `Health` and `Damage Resistance`
- **Force** (For) - Strengthens `Weapon Damage` and `Knockback`
- **Wisdom** (Wis) - Expands `Mana Pool` and reduces `Skill Cooldowns`
- **Agility** (Agi) - Boost `Movement Speed`, `I-Frames` and `Recovery Rate`

Together, they form the playful phrase “End For Wisagi”, making an emphasis on the game's combat and progression system.
