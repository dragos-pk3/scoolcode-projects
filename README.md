# Scoolcode Platform Projects

### While I was a Logiscool Trainer, I've worked on some personal projects that helped me understand and better teach on the Scoolcode platform. 

*Note that I've saved the files as .js files but the actual programming language for the Scoolcode platform is StageScript*
